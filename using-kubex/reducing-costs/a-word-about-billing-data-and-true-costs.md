# &#x20;A word about billing data and “true” costs

**Q.  Are the CSP costs listed in the Densify Console, from customer-negotiated pricing with our CSP or standard list pricing?**

A.   Densify Console pricing information is based on regional CSP cost data which Densify updates regularly.  If you have a negotiated discount, that you want to apply please let your Densify Account Manager know and a global discount can be applied to values in the Densify Console. Cost information in the Densify Containers dashboards is a manually-configured cost per core and per GB of memory. Contact your Densify Account Manage if you want to update your configuration with different costs.

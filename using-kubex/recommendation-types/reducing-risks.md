# Reducing Risks

**Kubernetes risks include;**

* CPU Throttling
* Pod Out of Memory (OOM) kills and container process termination

> Fix risk first then save money by downsizing

Risk are caused by the deployment of containers with unset or poorly set request and limit values for CPU and memory resources.

#### Reducing Risk

1. **Comprehensive Analysis**:
   * Kubex conducts deep analysis of Kubernetes environments, including both containers and nodes.
   * Recommendations are made based on the entire infrastructure context to avoid harmful changes.
2. **Cost and Risk Awareness**:
   * Many organizations experience a blind spot regarding costs and risks associated with Kubernetes.
   * The software addresses potential waste and resource sensitivity, ensuring stability before efficiency.
3. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
   * The system identifies and highlights containers and nodes at risk, such as those exceeding memory limits or causing restarts due to memory issues.
4. **Data-Driven Recommendations**:
   * Recommendations are provided based on historical data and usage patterns, ensuring that changes will not negatively impact the system.

#### Performance Improvement

1. **Optimization of Resources**:
   * Kubex identifies oversized containers and recommends adjustments to reduce resource waste, which can lead to significant cost savings.
2. **Automated Solutions**:
   * Automation options such as our [Mutating Admission Controller](../../automation.md) are available to streamline the implementation of recommended changes, minimizing manual intervention.
3. **Customizable Views**:
   * Users can create tailored views and filters to analyze specific aspects of their environments, helping to focus on critical performance metrics.
4. **Integration with Existing Systems**:
   * Kubex can [integrate with existing deployment pipelines](../../apis/), enabling seamless updates and configurations based on recommendations.

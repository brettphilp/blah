# Using Kubex

The primary screen of the Kubex user interface consists of a [navigator tree with views and filters](https://www.densify.com/docs-kubex/Content/Videos/Using%20the%20Tree%20Viewer.htm)  where you can contextually display a series of histograms that categorize containers based on their CPU and memory configuration.  Users can create tailored views and filters to analyze specific aspects of their environments, helping to focus on critical performance metrics.

# Using Kubex

The primary screen of the Kubex user interface consists of a [navigator tree with views and filters](https://www.densify.com/docs-kubex/Content/Videos/Using%20the%20Tree%20Viewer.htm)  where you can contextually display a series of views such as Summary, Breakdown, Histograms and AI Analysis Details that categorize containers based on their CPU and memory configuration.  The views offer drill down capability to dive deeper into specific aspects of your Kubernetes workloads.  Users can create tailored views and filters to analyze specific aspects of their environments, helping to focus on critical performance metrics.

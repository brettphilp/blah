# A word about billing data and “true” costs

Public cloud CSP pricing information in Densify is based on regional CSP cost data which Densify updates regularly. If you have a negotiated discount, that you want to apply please let your Densify Account Manager know and a global discount can be applied to values in the Densify Console.&#x20;

Cost information in the Densify Containers dashboards is a manually-configured cost per core and per GB of memory. Contact your Densify Account Manage if you want to update your configuration with different costs.

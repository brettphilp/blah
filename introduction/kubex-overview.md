# Kubex Overview

The Kubex product is designed to serve as a diagnostic tool, much like an MRI, for your Kubernetes environments. It identifies inefficiencies and provides actionable insights, ensuring that even the most sophisticated setups can achieve balanced resource allocation. With this tool, stakeholders can proactively address operational risks, effectively managing their container landscapes for optimal performance and cost efficiency.

The Kubex interface provides a comprehensive, at-a-glance view of your entire container landscape, helping you understand resource allocations from both a performance (Reducing Risk) and a cost-saving (Reducing Waste) perspective.
